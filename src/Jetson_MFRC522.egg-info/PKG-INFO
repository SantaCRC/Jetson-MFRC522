Description: # RFID library for Jetson Family
        This is a simple python library that provides a way to communicate jetson devices with MFRC522 modules
        
        ## Installation
        The easier way to install is through pip
        ```
        pip install Jetson-MFRC522
        ```
        also you can install it manually by clone the repo and run pip install command
        ## Example
        This is a simple example that read id and text in RFID card, tested in Jetson Nano.
        ```python
        from time import sleep
        import sys
        from Jetson_MFRC522 import SimpleMFRC522
        reader = SimpleMFRC522()
        
        try:
            while True:
                print("Hold a tag near the reader")
                id, text = reader.read()
                print("ID: %s\nText: %s" % (id,text))
                sleep(5)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            GPIO.cleanup()
